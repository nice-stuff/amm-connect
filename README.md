Crude example of connecting to the virtual console of blades on an old IBM bladecenter.

It skips the step of finding a browser which can run Java applets....

It works by logging in to the AMM, fetch the java JAR file and connect using Java directly.

Tested on a IBM Bladecenter H (using Linux as the client)
